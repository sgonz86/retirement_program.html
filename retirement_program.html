    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application transforms the linear event program into an interactive digital guide. The structure uses distinct sections: a main "Order of Events" with clickable items to reveal details, a "Tribute" section for biographical context, and a "Key Personnel" section for clarity. This thematic grouping, combined with click-to-explore interactivity, is chosen over a static list to enhance user engagement and provide a more comprehensive, easy-to-navigate experience for ceremony attendees. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Event Program -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz: Interactive vertical timeline/list -> Interaction: Click on an event to toggle visibility of a details panel. Justification: This adds depth and encourages exploration without cluttering the main view. Library: Vanilla JS for DOM manipulation. Tribute Section -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Styled text block. Personnel Section -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Styled list. Justification: These present textual information clearly. NO SVG/Mermaid used as no complex diagrams or charts are needed for this report. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                    <p>In 2014, Senior Chief Gonzalez's dedication led him to Naval Expeditionary Intelligence Command in Virginia Beach, where he served as Command Master-At-Arms. His hard work was honored with the Senior Sailor of the Year award in 2016 and a promotion to Chief Petty Officer. His next assignment took him to San Diego, California, aboard the USS LAKE CHAMPLAIN (CG-57). As the Command Chief Master-At-Arms, he was a key legal advisor to the ship's leadership during a deployment that spanned the Pacific.</p>
                    <p>His final overseas tour was in Rota, Spain, where he was the Physical Security Leading Chief Petty Officer. Promoted to E-8, he was later named the Anti-terrorism and Physical Security Leading Chief Petty Officer. Senior Chief Gonzalez concluded his distinguished career back home in New Jersey, serving as the Senior Enlisted Leader for Naval Security Forces at Naval Weapons Station Earle.</p>
